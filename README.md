# GRANU
- **G**et
- **RA**ndom
- **NU**mber

An overcomplicated mess for an issue no one has!

You ever need a random number? What about two? thirty? five-hundred?  
Studying sorting algorithms and need a random list of numbers?

Well maybe keep searching because this is probably the worst thing you can use, but it works!

If you want it anyway then open up your terminal and type:

`git clone https://github.com/SollyMollyDolly/granu  
cd granu  
gcc -std=c23 -o granu granu.c`

If you don't wanna use c23 then add #include `#include <stdbool.h>` to the file before compiling, maybe it works, idk.



Let me know why my code is something to be ashamed of and how to fix it at SollyMollyDolly@gmail.com
